## About this project ü§î
This project is part of ** DevOps Lab** for the GL5 DevOps field. We are meant to create a distributed application, then use it with different tools to put to real field different DevOps concepts.

**Scouts Tunisia Camp System** is an application that offers you a safe space to share your memories in your scouting adventures & camps and explore & like other's memories. It's a Frontend/Backend application with basic CRUD features and a DB connection.

You can access the **Memory Space** [here](http://4.211.64.22/register) ü•≥

It uses the **monorepo** strategy:    

1- **front-service/tunisian-scouts-system-app** : The frontend application that will be exposed to the users.   
2- **auth-service**: a service that handles authentification and users. 
3- **reservation-service**: the core of the application (CRUD functions).  
4- **infrastructure**: diffrent files to prepare the deployment of the app infra and the app setup.   
5- **terraform-microstacks**: terraform files to initiate the infrastructure of the project.

## Getting Started

In order to run this project and extend its functionalities you need to follow some few steps : 

### Prerequisites

* Make sure that Node.js (>= 10.13.0, except for v13) is installed on your operating system. ( [Download Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
* Make sure that Docker is installed.
* Make sure that Helm and terraform are installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/oumaima-kboubi/Scouts-Tunisia-Camp-System.git
   ```
##### If you want to build on top of the project   

2. Install NPM packages under each project
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2.1 Add a **.env** file for required projects
   ```sh
   #AUTH-SERVICE
   MONGO_URI="MongoDb connection string" # for auth-service
   APP_PORT=3001
   TOKEN_KEY="whatever you choose"   # for the JWT Token
   
   #RESERVATION-SERVICE
   MONGO_URI="MongoDb connection string" # for reservation-service
   APP_PORT=3002
   ...
   ```
 2.2 run all projects, ensure that all ports are well set and enjoy!   
 
##### Or if you want to use docker   
 
 3. make sure you have docker installed.
 
 3.1. pull the images : 
 ``` sh
 docker pull oumaimakboubi/ms-auth:latest # auth-service
 docker pull oumaimakboubi/ms-reservation:latest # reservation-service
 docker pull oumaimakboubi/ms-front:latest # front-service
 ```
 
 3.2 run the following docker run command:  
 ``` sh
 sudo docker run -d -p 3001:3001 --name ms-auth oumaimakboubi/ms-auth:latest
 sudo docker run -d -p 3002:3002 --name ms-auth oumaimakboubi/ms-reservation:latest
 sudo docker run -d -p 4200:4200 --name ms-auth oumaimakboubi/ms-front:latest
 ```
##### Or if you want to use terraform and helm   

4. make sure you have terraform and helm installed.   

4.1 make sure you have an azure account and a valid connection   
4.2 run the following terrafom commands in **each microstack**:   
 ``` sh
 terraform init
 terraform apply
 ```

## Devops   

This project implement the principles of observability, automation and deployment like so:   

### Observebalitiy       

#### 1- Metrics   

I used `prometheus` and and `prom-client` in NodeJS  to expose  http metrics (number of total requests ... ).

**Business logic metrics** : i used business related metrcis which presents a general statistics on the App (number of successful login requests, number of added memory articles ..)
# image metrics
#### 2- Logs
# image logs
I used the implemented `Logger` logic in NodeJS  and just added a request id , a timestamp of the request as well as different levels of logs.   

### Automation       

####  Microstacks    

The goal of microstacks is to create a well isolated and maintainable infrastructure layers.   

1. **First Stack**: This stack is dedicated to the kubernetes cluster provisioning.

2. **Second Stack**: this stack takes care of creating the infrastructure for this project.

3. **Third Stack**: This section takes care of installing ingress-controller in the cluster

# general overview on the RG image

### Deployment       

####  YAML files    

Each of the services has its own YAML files in an ordred way    

1. **Deployment** we can add arbitrary labels by chnaging the ```values.yaml``` file in this section
```
labelsAuth: #auth-service
  app: ms-auth
  env: production
labelsRes:  #reservation-service
  app: ms-reservation
  env: production
labelsFront: #front-service
  app: ms-front
  env: production

```

2. **Service**

3. **Ingress**

4. **Secrets**

üí° These files varies from a service to an other depnding on its requirments

####  HELM Chart    
I used Helm Charts to facilitate the use of Terraform microstacks when installing the infrastructure and the app 
The helm chart can be configured through this file ```values.yaml``` fot it to be more generic and empowers scalability and maintenability.

```

deployment:
  replicas: 3
image:
  tag: latest
  authname: oumaimakboubi/ms-auth:latest
  reservationname: oumaimakboubi/ms-reservation:latest
  frontname: oumaimakboubi/ms-front:latest
http:
  frontendport: 4200
  authport: 3001
  reservationport: 3002
labelsAuth:  # This is a way to add arbitrary labels to the deployments
  app: ms-auth
  env: production
labelsRes:
  app: ms-reservation
  env: production
labelsFront:
  app: ms-front
  env: production
  
```

## CI pipeline
The project pipeline code can be found under `.github/workflows`, this is a simple pipeline that just ensures at each push command to the github repo to build the image then save it in the DOCKERHUB repo.

All the jobs are running in parrallel in order to make the image building and pushing musch faster.

# image de pipeline && dockerhub link
# add icns baliz
